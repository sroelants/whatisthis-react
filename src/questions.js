    The <code>.call()</code> method, defined for function objects, allows one to 
    explicitely pass a value for <code>this</code> as its first argument. Note 
    that <code>this</code> need not refer to a javascript object, but can be any
    datatype, even a string or an integer.
    <em>Fun fact:</em> All function calls, behind the screens, are transformed 
    by javascript to an invocation of the <code>call()</code> method. Running a 
    top-level function <code>fun()</code> is translated by javascript to
    <code>fun.call(window)</code> (or <code>fun.call(undefined)</code>, if we are
    in strict mode.

    This one is tricky. <code>printEmotionalState</code> is a top-level function 
    that is called in a global context, so we would expect <code>this</code> to
    refer to the <code>window</code> object. However, <code>printEmotionalState
    </code> invokes <code>mascot.printMood</code> <em>using the <code>call</code>
    method</em> and binding <code>this</code> back to <code>mascot</code> 
    explicitely!

    This is a trick question that has more to do with constructors than it does
    with <code>this</code>. In a typical constructor call (that is, a function
    that is called with the <code>new</code> keyword and returns an object), the
    the <code>this</code> keyword refers to the newly created object, and is
    returned by the constructor call. <em>But</em>, if we wanted to, we can 
    make the constructor return <em>any</em> object we wish by explicitely 
    adding a <code>return</code> statement returning an object. In this case,
    the <code>Flanders</code> constructor creates a new Flanders instance with
    <code>name</code> set to "Rod", but <em>instead</em> returns a different
    object, with <code>name</code> set to "Todd". The creation of the first 
    object is essentially for nothing.
